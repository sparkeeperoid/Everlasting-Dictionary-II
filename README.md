A personal dictionary Android application made to list down new words that I've learned...especially from FINAL FANTASY XIV.
This entire thingamajig was vibe-coded by Gemini Pro 2.5 as a part of me testing it, having heard hearsays of how good it is.
And my God, it really developed the entire thing from bottom to top. We're truly living in a world.

**Functions**
- Basic CRUD operations, such as adding, editing, and deletion of words.
- When adding or editing a word, a jingle from FINAL FANTASY XIV plays.
- Said jingles feature from A REALM REBORN to ENDWALKER quest start/completion jingles. Eureka and Bozjia jingles are also included.
- Widgets that show a random word by hour.

**Future Funcitons**
- Sort by category (e.g. sort by words learned in SHADOWBRINGERS and other sources)
- Splash screen with logo and sound
